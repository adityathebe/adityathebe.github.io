description: Learn how make money on YouTube from Nepal with me in these few easy steps. I have been earning for few years now from Nepal.
---

There are lots of ways you can earn money online from Nepal. YouTubeÂ &Â Blogging are few of them. In this article, I will specifically talk about **earning from YouTube**. If you are thinking whetherÂ you can earn from Nepal or not,Â then yes you absolutely can! I myself have been earning from YouTube for few years now.

I am not a full-time YouTuber and I just post random stuffs rarely. But yet, I have managed to make few hundred dollarsÂ so far. Now you get the idea of the potential revenue you can earn as a full-time YouTuber.

> #### NOTE: YouTube policy has changed over time and now it's much more difficult to start a career in YouTube. You need to have at least the following things covered to be able to monetize videos
> 
- **1000+ subscribers**
- **4000 hours watched (in last 12 months)**
- **10,000 channel views**

### Why YouTube?

1. You don't need an investment!
2. You don't to need to work everyday for hours. Just upload the video and sit back while your videos earn you some cash.
3. You don't need to be a talented freak to earn from YouTube.Â You can post videos on anything from songs covers to makeup tutorial or whatever you're good with. But make sure to upload your original content and not someone else's video. Because YouTube will punish you with a copyright strike. 3 copyright strike means your account will be banned forever.
  
Here is my earnings on YouTube I have made so far (March 2016).

![Youtube Earning](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/YouTube-earning-March-2016.png)

I know 32k isn't much but considering I haven't uploaded videos for over a year now, it's a pretty good deal !

I have summarized the process in the following steps :

## 1. Create A YouTube Account

Creating a YouTube account takes just 2 minutes andÂ most of you may already have it. Your Gmail account is your YouTube account.

For the sake of this tutorial, I will create a new YouTube/Gmail account.

1. Click <a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignUp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here </a>to sign up if you don't have a Gmail account.
2. Fill up the forms and create a new Gmail account.

Now you've created yourself a YouTube account. Go toÂ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>Â and login into your account.

## 2. Create A YouTube Channel

After you have created a YouTube account you will also need to create a YouTube channel. Without a channel, you have no public presence on YouTube. You cannot comment on videos, upload or make playlists without a channel.

1. Login to your YouTube account.
2. On the navigation panel to the left, click "My channel" tab.
  
  ![My Channel Link Youtube](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/1.-My-Channel.png)

3. A dialogue box will appear. Fill up the details and click continue.
  ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/2.-create-channel.png)
4. You can now decorate your channel with cover image and profile pictures. Add channel descriptions if you want. Don't forget to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/verify_phone_number" target="_blank" rel="noopener">verify your channel</a>. You will need a mobile phone to complete the verification.

_Note: You can create multiple channels with the same YouTube account. But I don't recommend it._

## 3. Setting Up YouTube channel for Monetization

Monetization means to show advertisements on your YouTube channel. As I have mentioned above, it is ads that earns you $$$.

Unfortunately, YouTube hasn't made monetization available inÂ Nepal. However, there's a little trick you can use to fool Google!

1. On the top right corner, click on the channel logo. After that, click on the **Gear Icon**Â beside "Creator Studio" button.
  
    ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/3.-Settings.png)

2. Click on "View additional features"
  
    ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/4.-additional-features.png)

3. You can see that YouTube hasn't made monetization available in Nepal.
  
    ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/5.-Not-Available.png)
  
4. On the panel to the left, click on "advanced_"
  
    ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/6.-Advance.png)
  
5. Now this is where we fool Google. Change the country to any other country where monetization is available. I prefer choosing "**India**". After that, scroll down to the bottom and click "save".
  
    ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/7.-choose-country.png)

6. Great! Now your channel is eligible for monetization. On the panel to left, click on the "tatus and features" tabs.
  
    ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/8.-status-and-features.png)
  
7. Finally, click on "*Enable**"
  
    ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/9.-Enable.png)
  
8. Click on "nable my account". Tick on all the check-mark boxes and click on " agree". You can read the Program Terms if you want but who does!
  
    ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/10.-Accept.png)

You're good to go now. Your channel is enabled for monetization. Is that it? Nope, you need to Create an Adsense account and link it with your YouTube channel to finally be able to show ads on your videos.

## 4. Linking YouTube with Adsense

To earn from Google (YouTube), anÂ Adsense account is a must. Google Adsense is where you'll be managing all your ads and your revenues(earnings).Â AdSense enables you to earn money by placing targeted text and image ads with your videos.Â Google automatically chooses which ads to show based on your video content, and you earn money when visitors view or click on these ads.

There are two types of AdSense account 
  - **Hosted AdSense Account**
  - **Regular AdSense account**

The difference between them is with a hosted account you can only show ads on Google hosted platforms like YouTube <del>&Â Blogger</del> and with a Regular AdSense account you can show on any websites you like, any of your YouTube videos and your mobile apps.

If you just want to earn from YouTube then you will need create a hosted account because it's easier to get it than a Regular AdSense account.

Let's start!

  1. Go to [Features](https://www.youtube.com/features){:target="_blank"}Â section on your channel.
  2. Click on [view monetization settings](https://www.youtube.com/account_monetization"){:target="_blank"}
  
      ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/11.-View-monetization-setting.png)

  3. Click on "How will I be paid". Then, click on ["associate an AdSense account"](https://www.youtube.com/account_monetization?action_adsense_connection=1)"
  
      ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/12.-How-will-I-be-paid.png)

  4. Click on the "Next" button and you'll be redirected to Adsense page.
  
      ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/13.-Next.png)

  5. Click "Yes" and then on the next page click "Continue".
  
      ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/14.-Yes.png)

  6. Make sure to provide authentic address and contact number before you submit the form.
  
      ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/15.-Adsense-fill-up.png)

  7. Your AdSense account will be reviewed by Google and you'll receive an email after confirmation. This might take days or even weeks. Patience is the key here.
  
      ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/16.-Done.png)

  8. Once your adsense account is reveiewed and approved, Google will send you an email which looks something like this
  
      ![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/Google-Adsense-youtube-approved-email.png)
  
## 5. Upload And Monetize

You're just one step away from earning on YouTube! Upload a video ( original content ) and monetize it. To check if your video is monetized or not, go to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/my_videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Video Manager</a>.Â If you see a blueÂ dollar sign then your video has been monetized.

## 6. Verifying Google Adsense

This is a very important step. Without verifying your AdSense account you won't be able to receive your earning no matter how much you earn.Â Verifying AdSense means to prove to GoogleÂ that you're a real person living in the address you have provided. To verify your AdSense account, you should first earn $10. After you've earned at least $10 in your AdSense account, Google will send a mail (card), with a verification code inside it, to your address.Â This is what the card looks like.

![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/google_card_aditya_thebe.jpg)

Inside it is a verification code which you should enter in your AdSense account. Once Google sends that card, you'll receive a notification in your AdSense account just like the screenshot below.

> Your payments are currently on hold because you have not verified your address

![](/assets/images/uploads/2016/03/Adsense-pin-verification-notification-aditya.png)

If you click on the "Action" button it will take you to another page where you should enter the PIN. Once you receive the card at your address, enter the pin in your AdSense account and then you'll have a verified Google AdSense account. ðŸ™‚

> It may take up to 30-45 days to receive the post card to your address. If you don't receive the mail within 2 months the request for another card. However, you can only request for 3 PIN.

![](/assets/images/uploads/2016/03/Adsense-pin-verification-notification.png)
  
If you have provided your address correctly then you'll have no problem in receiving the card. However, sometimesÂ you'll have trouble verifying your AdSense. This is because GoogleÂ doesn't recognize most of the parts of Nepal.

I had the same problem and I had to wait for months to finally know that Google couldn't recognize my address.

Here's a trick I used. Go to <a href="https://www.google.com.np/maps" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Maps</a>Â and locate your location. Provide exactly the same address on the Google Map to your AdSense account.

![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/16.-Maps.png)

Example: Instead of writing "ukti Chowk, Jhapa" you should write "ukti Chowk,Â East-West Highway, Anarmani, 57204, Jhapa, Nepal"

Finally, Google will send a card containing a code to the nearest post-office Â & the postman will deliver it to your home.

## 7. Choose your Payment Method

This is the question I get asked the most!Â There are three ways you can receive your payment of Youtube_**Â in Nepal**.

  * Through Cheque (not recommended)
  * Through Western UnionÂ (recommended)
  * Through Bank TransferÂ (recommended)

Please, remember that if youâ€™ve created an Youtube & AdsenseÂ account from other countries (United States, Uk, etc) youâ€™ll have extra modes of receiving payment. _For example: you can receive your AdSense (YouTube) payment through Payoneer if you have a US AdSense account.

> **Your YouTube earnings will be added to your AdSense account before the 15th of the next month.Â _Once your earning is added to your AdSense account, Google will send the payment only after the 21st of that month.** 
> 
> **_For Example_Â &#8211; if you earned $100 in March, then that $100 will be added to your AdSense account before the 15th of April. _Generally between 12-15th of April (next_ month).**_ **Once your earning is added to your AdSense account, Google will send the payment only after 21st of April (next month)**._

A Little advice - Do not ever use cheque as your method of payment. Because
  
1. It will take anywhere from 30-45 days before you receive your cheque.
2. 15-30 more days to withdraw the amount from the Cheque.  
3. You'll need to have an account on that bank to cash the cheque.
4. Most banksÂ won't even cash your Google cheque.  
5. Even if they do, they'll charge you anywhere from Rs 500 to Rs 2000.

So eventually you'll receive 90% of your earning after 60-70 days. Unless you don't have access to Western Union or you don't have a bank account, I strongly recommend **not to use** Cheque payment method.

**Note: _Adsense will only pay you once you've reached $100._**

Here is the Cheque payment I received from Google.

### Congratulations !!!

Youâ€™re now a verified YouTuber. But thereâ€™s still more to learn. You can maximize your earnings with these few tips. <a href="http://www.adityathebe.com/blog/how-to-make-more-money-on-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check it out here</a>.

### Few things to consider:

  1. Always try to upload your original content. YouTube takes copyright very seriously! 3 copyright claims and your YouTube account is banned.
  2. Uploading videos is not enough. You need to get traffic to it. Share it and ask your friends to share it.
  3. There's no fixed value about how much you'll earn from certain number of views. 1000 views in one video might earn you $0.5 while 1000 views on some other video might earn you $5. But in average, from my experience, you'll earn $1 for 1000 views.

Take a look at these images below:

![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/high-income-with-low-views.png)*High Revenue with low views*

As you can see in the above analytic data, this video has just 10 views but managed to earn $1.29 ! But in the picture below, my video earned just $0.03 from more than 20,000 views !

![](/assets/images/uploads/2015/09/low-income-with-high-views.png)*Low Revenue with high views*

so whyâ€™s that? Because **not every views are monetized** ! I went to my YouTube analytic and checked the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/analytics?o=U#dt=tm,fe=16884,fr=lw-001,fs=16861;fcr=0,r=adtype,rpr=d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad Rates</a> tab. I found out that only 136 of the total video views were monetized. Which means from 20,000 views only 136 views showed ads. That is just 0.68% of monetized views.

On average _11%-20%_ of views are monetized.
